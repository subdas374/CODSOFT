<h2 id="project-descriptions">Project Descriptions</h2>

<h3>1.<a href="https://github.com/subdas374/CODSOFT/tree/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction"> Titanic Survival Prediction :cruise_ship:</a></h3>
<p>In this project, I developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, fare, etc. I explored the data, performed data preprocessing, and trained a model to predict survival.</p>

<h3>2.<a href="https://github.com/subdas374/CODSOFT/tree/main/Movie%20Rating%20Prediction"> Movie Rating Prediction with Python</a></h3>
<p>In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. I utilized a dataset containing information about movies, including genres, actors, directors, and user ratings. By analyzing this data, I developed a model to predict movie ratings based on the provided features.</p>

<h3>3.<a href="https://github.com/subdas374/CODSOFT/tree/main/Iris_flower_classification"> Iris Flower Classification</a></h3>
<p>This project involved the classification of Iris flower species based on features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. I used machine learning algorithms to train a model that can accurately classify different Iris flower types.</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://github.com/subdas374/CODSOFT/tree/main/Sales_prediction">Sales Prediction Using Python</a></h3>
<p>In this project, I developed a sales prediction model using Python. The dataset consisted of historical sales data, including information about products, regions, and time periods. I utilized various data analysis techniques to predict future sales and identify trends and patterns in the data.</p>

<h3>5.<a href="https://github.com/subdas374/CODSOFT/tree/main/Credit_card_fraud_detection"> Credit Card Fraud Detection</a></h3>
<p>The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. I employed machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing transaction information, including features like transaction amount, time, and various anonymized variables. The goal was to build a model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions.</p>
